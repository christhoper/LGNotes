// A subclass of `NSBitmapImageRep` to fix that GIF loop count issue because `NSBitmapImageRep` will reset `NSImageCurrentFrameDuration` by using `kCGImagePropertyGIFDelayTime` but not `kCGImagePropertyGIFUnclampedDelayTime`.
// Built in GIF coder use this instead of `NSBitmapImageRep` for better GIF rendering. If you do not want this, only enable `HDWebImageImageIOCoder`, which just call `NSImage` API and actually use `NSBitmapImageRep` for GIF image.
